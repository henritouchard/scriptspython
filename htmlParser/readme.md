Hello and welcome on my github account!

This little scrapper is an old and fast developped scrapper to get some products informations simultaneously on Fnac.com, saturn and amazon
it has been coded around january 2017 and it's probably not working anymore but if you're looking for an example to build your own scrapper with python and requests library it could help a bit (i had no time to do this, so it's probably draft work. In case you need it in production, think about a better way!).
